# Sorted Sequences

An implementation of a Sorted Sequence, based on the book "Sequential and Parallel Algorithms and Data Structures" by Peter Sanders, Kurt Mehlhorn, Martin Dietzfelbinger and Roman Dementiev.
Developed as part of my proseminar about Sorted Sequences.

**`bulkInsert`:** Sadly, the feature of parallel bulk insertion is not ready yet. The current process is to be observed on branch _bulkInsert_.
